Once upon a time there was a man named Joe who had a dog named Buddy. One day Joe was taking Buddy out for a walk when they got seperated and Joe ended up losing Buddy. Joe spent hours in the woods looking for buddy but could not find him. Eventually he got all his neighbors involved in the search for Buddy but nobody could find him. 

Then, one day, Joe's doorbell rang. Hoping it might be someone with news about Buddy, Joe ran to his door, but when he opened it he saw no one standing there. Instead, he discovered it was another dog! Joe looked around to see if the dog's owner was anywhere to be found, but he didn't see anyone, only the new dog sitting on his porch. The dog motioned eagerly for Joe to follow him. Eventually Joe gave in, letting the dog lead him away from his house and into the woods.

It was getting dark and Joe was beginning to question why he was following a random dog throughout the woods. Right as he was about to turn around and go home, Joe heard muffled barking in the distance. The dog took off running towards the barking and Joe sprinted after him. Finally they get to the source of the barking and Joe is shocked to find a deep hole, with an elderly man and his beloved dog buddy sitting at bottom. Joe helped the man and he explained that the dog Joe was with was his service dog and that he fell into the hole a few days earlier while walking him. Buddy also fell into the hole shortly after. The man hugged Joe and thanked him for helping him. The man and Joe became friends and they still walk their dogs together every Sunday. The end.
